/**
 * Liveness signal for the container healthcheck.
 *
 * The heartbeat file's modification time is the only thing the healthcheck reads, and it is
 * refreshed only while the long polling loop keeps cycling. Nothing outside the process can see
 * that on its own: polling runs on a scheduled executor, so the loop can stop while the JVM stays
 * up and the container stays `Up` forever.
 *
 * Freshness follows the poll loop rather than whether Telegram answers, so a brief outage upstream
 * does not make every bot unhealthy at once over something restarting them cannot fix. A long one
 * still does, and that is the useful part: the session's backoff decays to a 15-minute retry
 * interval, and at that point the bot is polling in name only and a restart is what clears it.
